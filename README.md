# Teachable Machine Object Detection
 This project uses a machine learning model that I created in Teachable Machine to help classify images from a webcam in real-time. The program is written in Python and uses OpenCV and TensorFlow. For more information about how I created the project and to learn how to create an object detection project yourself, you can view a demo video and read my Instructable detailing the project at the links below:
